    ```
    pip install pyqt5 pyqt5-tools
    ```
    now it can be found somewhere inside the python installation files named designer.exe

    Further information are available under: 
    https://realpython.com/qt-designer-python/#getting-started-with-qt-designer

2. To generate *.py code from the *.ui type into python command prompt (not Spyder console)
    ```
    pyuic5 -x <source> -o <output> 
    ```
    Where source and output correspond to the filenames including the path, it is also possible to navigate to the folder beforehand.
    The generated file should not be changed, as all changes will be lost if it is generated again.
